Candle is a minimalist ML framework for Rust with a focus on easiness of use and
on performance (including GPU support). Try our online demos: 
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[llama2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2).

```rust
let a = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (2, 3), &Device::Cpu)?;
let b = Tensor::randn(0f32, 1., (3, 4), &Device::Cpu)?;

let c = a.matmul(&b)?;
println!("{c}");
```

## Check out our examples

Check out our [examples](./candle-examples/examples/):

- [Whisper](./candle-examples/examples/whisper/): speech recognition model.
- [Llama and Llama-v2](./candle-examples/examples/llama/): general LLM.
- [Falcon](./candle-examples/examples/falcon/): general LLM.
- [Bert](./candle-examples/examples/bert/): useful for sentence embeddings.
- [StarCoder](./candle-examples/examples/bigcode/): LLM specialized to code
  generation.

Run them using the following commands:
```
cargo run --example whisper --release
cargo run --example llama --release
cargo run --example falcon --release
cargo run --example bert --release
cargo run --example bigcode --release
```

In order to use **CUDA** add `--features cuda` to the example command line.

There are also some wasm examples for whisper and
[llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c). You can either build them with
`trunk` or try them online:
[whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-whisper),
[llama2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2).

For llama2, run the following command to retrieve the weight files and start a
test server:
```bash
cd candle-wasm-examples/llama2-c
wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin
wget https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/raw/master/tokenizer.bin
trunk serve --release --public-url /candle-llama2/ --port 8081
```
And then browse to
[http://localhost:8081/candle-llama2](http://localhost:8081/candle-llama2).

## FAQ

### Why Candle?

Candle stems from the need to reduce binary size in order to *enable serverless*
possible by making the whole engine smaller than PyTorch very large library volume.
This enables creating runtimes on a cluster much faster.

And simply *removing Python* from production workloads.
Python can really add overhead in more complex workflows and the [GIL](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-python-gil-past-present-and-future/) is a notorious source of headaches.

Rust is cool, and a lot of the HF ecosystem already has Rust crates [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) and [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).


### Other ML frameworks

- [dfdx](https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx) is a formidable crate, with shapes being included
  in types preventing a lot of headaches by getting compiler to complain about shape mismatch right off the bat
  However we found that some features still require nightly and writing code can be a bit daunting for non rust experts.

  We're leveraging and contributing to other core crates for the runtime so hopefully both crates can benefit from each
  other

- [burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) is a general crate that can leverage multiple backends so you can choose the best
  engine for your workload

- [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs.git) Bindings to the torch library in Rust. Extremely versatile, but they 
  do bring in the entire torch library into the runtime. The main contributor of `tch-rs` is also involved in the development
  of `candle`.

### Missing symbols when compiling with the mkl feature.

If you get some missing symbols when compiling binaries/tests using the mkl
features, e.g.:
```
  = note: /usr/bin/ld: (....o): in function `blas::sgemm':
          .../blas-0.22.0/src/lib.rs:1944: undefined reference to `sgemm_' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  = note: some `extern` functions couldn't be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
  = note: use the `-l` flag to specify native libraries to link
  = note: use the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive to specify the native libraries to link with Cargo (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#cargorustc-link-libkindname)
```

This is likely due to some missing linker flag that enable the mkl library. You
can try adding the following at the top of your binary:
```
extern crate intel_mkl_src;
```

### How to know where an error comes from.

You can set `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` to be provided with backtraces when a candle
error is generated.
